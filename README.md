# Rubyzip
## Next generation dev branch

This is Rubyzip next-gen. It is a full re-write of Rubyzip from scratch. Rubyzip has become unwieldy to maintain, and would benefit from a new start. Some features, such as encryption, are not implemented in a particularly friendly way - perhaps forced in, rather than planned for.

Along the way we will return to the ZIP specification and make sure that we adhere, while also accomodating rogue ZIP archives where possible (looking at you, OSX Archive Tool).
